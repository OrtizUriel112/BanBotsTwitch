## Configurate Enviroment ðŸ’»

### **Step 1**
#### You need to install node dependencies.
on your **shell**.
```
npm install tmi.js
```
> Remember to be inside the BanBotsTwitch folder and be at the root of the project before executing the command. 
### **Step 2**
#### Find **.env.example** file on this project, copy and paste .env.example file, edit file name as **.env** and open this file with your code editor. 

### **Step 3**
#### Set your credentials in each header.
```
- username=
- password=
- channel=
```
- **Username**
    - The account (username) that the chatbot uses to send chat messages. This can be your Twitch account. Alternately, many developers choose to create a second Twitch account for their bot, so it's clear from whom the messages originate.
- **Password (OAUTH_TOKEN)**
    - The token to authenticate your chatbot with Twitch's servers. Generate this with [TwitchApps](https://twitchapps.com/tmi/) (a Twitch community-driven wrapper around the Twitch API), while logged in to your chatbot account. The token will be an alphanumeric string.
- **Channel**
    - The Twitch channel name where you want to run the bot. Usually this is your main Twitch account.

___
## Execution âš”
### **Step 1**
#### Create a file named "**List.txt**", this list will be read by the Script.

### **Step 2**
#### Inside the file "**List.txt**" we must write all the commands that will be read by the Script, **example**: 
```
/ban AnironilBrownQd5 bot
/ban AnironilDavisF4726 bot
/ban AnironilEdwardsBs7 bot
```
> If you find it hard to write **/ban AnironilBrownQd5 bot** over and over again, you can check out this other [Script](https://github.com/OrtizUriel112/SentencesUsersTwitch).
### **Step 3**
#### The Script has 2 commands for you to use.

```
!welcome
```
```
!banlist
```
- **Welcome**
    - Write a welcome to test that everything is fine, read the text written in "**Welcome.txt**".
- **BanList**
    - Start executing the code sentences that you have written in the "**List.txt**" file.
> While a command is executed you should not write anything else, wait for an instruction to finish properly.
